          <p>
            I am an MCA graduate and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner with a strong foundation in cloud computing and AWS services. I have completed the 12-week AWS re/Start program at Tech Mahindra SMART Academy, where I gained comprehensive knowledge of cloud architecture, best practices, and hands-on experience with services like EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, and RDS. <br /> <br />

            I am passionate about leveraging cloud solutions to solve real-world problems and ensure optimal performance in cloud environments. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by diving into the world of DevOps through a course on Udemy, where I am learning tools like Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, and Kubernetes. Iâ€™m actively applying these skills in projects that involve deploying and managing infrastructure on the AWS platform. <br /> <br />

            With a blend of development experience, cloud expertise, and growing proficiency in DevOps, I am eager to contribute to innovative teams and tackle complex challenges in cloud-native environments. Let's connect and explore opportunities in cloud and DevOps!
